# Siesta_Gardens

## Introductions

Siesta Gardens simulates a Dinosaur-based theme park centered around the viewing of a real-life dinosaur. 
People would arrive to the park in a boat and would be able to get into a vehicle that would take them around the park in order to view the dinosaur up close and take pictures.
The park is controlled by an underlying sytem in order to facilitate the movement of the vehicles, keep track of people visiting the park, and provide security measures in order to ensure the safety of the guests.
